# Customization

### Model : DreamBooth, TextualInversion, Custom-Diffusion, ProFusion   

In main.py, you can train above models.   

The original codes for DreamBooth, Textual-Inversion, and Custom-Diffusion are   
https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main.   
Download the datasets.   
Installation is required.   
```
pip install --upgrade diffusers[torch]
```

The original code for ProFusion is   
https://github.com/drboog/ProFusion/tree/main. 
Download the datasets.   
Installation is required.   
```
git clone https://github.com/drboog/ProFusion.git
cd ProFusion
mv diffusers profusion_diffusers
```
In setup.py, you can replce setup name with the name you prefer.   
```
python setup.py install
```
Change forder ./profusion_diffusers/src/profusion_diffusers/pipelines/pipeline_utils.py to pipeline_utils.py I uploaded.

## Metrics   

* Using the CLIP to measure Image-Image similarity between:
  * Train images ang generated images
  * Placeholder w/ and placeholder w/o
  * *ProFusion requires a single input image, so evaluation is not feasible.*

* Using the DINO model (ViT-B/32) to measure Image-Image similarity between:
    * Train images and generated images
* Using KID to measure Image-Image similarity between:
    * Class images found through retrieval and images generated through prompts for each retrieval (2 images per prompt)
    * *ProFusion requires a single input images, so evaluation is not feasible*
 
 * Using a pretrained face recognition model to measute Image-Image similarity between:
    * Train face images and generated face images.
    * Available models :   
    ["AdaFace", "VGG-Face", "Facenet", "OpenFace", "DeepFace", "ArcFace", "SFace"]
    * The original code of AdaFace is

    Installation of face_alignment and pretrained models.
    * All models except AdaFace utilize the deepface library.

* Using the CLIP model to measure Image-Text similarity between:
    * Generated images and prompts used for generating those images.
    * Available models :
